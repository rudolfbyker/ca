# Self-signed certificates

Become a Certificate Authority and sign your own certificates.

## Instructions

Before you start:

- You need a real or fake hostname (like `mypc.example.com`) that points to the server. You can set this up using your
  hosts file or some form of DNS.

### Create a Certificate Authority (CA)

```shell
./create_certificate_authority.py --help
```

- Be sure to encrypt the private key, and store the password in a proper password manager.
- You can do this once, and generate many certificates from the one CA.
- Any client that has the CA will trust all certificates generated by the CA.

### Create a certificate using the CA

```shell
./create_certificate.py --help
```

- You will need the password of the private key of the CA.

### Install the CA on the client

#### Globally on Ubuntu (also works on LinuxMint)

Normally, the CA file ends with .pem and the certificate file ends with .crt. However, Ubuntu wants the CA file to end
in .crt. Don’t get confused between these two files!

1. Make a link to your CA in /usr/local/share/ca-certificates
   ```shell
   ln -s /path/to/caname_ca.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/caname_ca.crt
   ```
2. Update your CA Store
   ```shell
   sudo update-ca-certificates
   ```

#### Globally on Windows

See https://www.supportyourtech.com/articles/how-to-add-certificate-to-trusted-root-windows-10-a-step-by-step-guide/

#### Locally in Chrome

For Chrome on Windows, see https://blog.eldernode.com/install-root-certificate-in-chrome/

#### Locally in Firefox

See https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/setting-certificate-authorities-firefox

### Install the certificate on the server

#### Nginx

In your site config, e.g. at `/etc/nginx/sites-enables/mysite`, replacing `443` with your preferred port, and `tld`
with the same domain name for which you generated the certificate:

```nginx
server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name tld;
  ssl_certificate "/path/to/tld.crt";
  ssl_certificate_key "/path/to/tld.key";
  ...
}
```

#### ISPConfig

On the website's SSL tab, paste the contents of these files into the corresponding fields:

- `out/ca/domain/private.key` → SSL Key
- `out/ca/domain/request.csr` → SSL Request
- `out/ca/domain/certificate.crt` → SSL Certificate
- `out/ca/root.pem` → SSL Bundle

#### Kubernetes

##### Create the TLS secret

Here `{{ .Values.crt | b64enc }}` is `helm` syntax. If you are not using helm, replace this with the base64-encoded
contents of the corresponding files.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: kubernetes.io/tls
metadata:
  name: my-certificate
  namespace: my-app
data:
  tls.crt: {{ .Values.crt | b64enc }}  # From `out/ca/domain/certificate.crt`
  tls.key: {{ .Values.key | b64enc }}  # From `out/ca/domain/private.key`
```

Alternatively, you can generate the above snippet using `kubectl`:

```shell
kubectl create secret tls --help
```

```shell
kubectl create secret tls my-certificate --key out/ca/domain/private.key --cert out/ca/domain/certificate.crt --dry-run=client --output=yaml 
```

##### Use the TLS secret in an ingress

This assumes you are using the nginx ingress controller.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
  namespace: my-app
spec:
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - mypc.example.com  # This has to be one of the domains passed to `create_certificate.py`.
      secretName: my-certificate
```

### Using your CA with cert-manager in Kubernetes

You can generate a root CA and give it to cert-manager to have certificates automatically generated for you Kubernetes
ingresses. Then you don't need the `create_certificate.py` script.

See https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/ca/
